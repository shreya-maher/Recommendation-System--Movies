# Recommendation-System--Movies

We delved into the domain of movie recommendation systems using an extensive dataset. Our objective centered around the creation of recommendation algorithms employing three core filtering methods: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering. Through  analysis, we compared and assessed the performances of these methodologies in suggesting movies to users. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly front-end application using Streamlit, showcasing the practical execution and functionality of these recommendation algorithms. This collective exploration provided insights into the strengths and intricacies of each filtering technique, not only by examining performance metrics but also by demonstrating real-world applicability through an intuitive interface. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of diverse strategies employed in movie recommendation systems.
